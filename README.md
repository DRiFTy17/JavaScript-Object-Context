Angular Change Tracker
====================

A change tracking module for AngularJS.

This module can be used as a standalone container to track client-side javascript objects for changes.

A working demo that uses the module can be found in [this plunker](http://plnkr.co/edit/YjvD9gb5iUvVVZC41g6s).

### Todo List:
* Finish implementing hooks for fetching and submitting loaded objects from/to the server.
* Add experimental support using Object.observe() as the change tracking engine.
* Unit tests.
* Add support for tracking changes to just arrays.
* Add a test project with .NET backend.
* Add the ability to track changes to specific properties.
